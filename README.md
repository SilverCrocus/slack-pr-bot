### Webhook Integration

```
https://your-server-url/webhook/pr
```

### Manual PR Notification

For testing or manual notification:
```python
from pr_review_bot import notify_pr_review

pr_data = {
    'title': 'Example PR',
    'repository': 'owner/repo',
    'author': 'username',
    'url': 'https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123'
}

notify_pr_review(pr_data)
```

### Claiming a Review

- When a PR review notification appears in the channel, team members can claim the review by reacting with the âœ… emoji
- The bot will update the message to indicate who claimed the review
- Nigel will be notified via DM when a review has been claimed

## Customization
